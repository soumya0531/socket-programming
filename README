Implement a TCP client and server which will communicate over the network and exchange data.
The server will start in passive mode listening for a transmission from the client. The client will then
start and contact the server (on a given IP address and port number). The client will pass the server a
string (eg: “network”) up to 80 characters in length.
On receiving a string from a client, the server should: 1) reverse all the characters, and 2) reverse the
capitalization of the strings (“network” would now become “KROWTEN”).
The server should then send the string back to the client. The client will display the received string
and exit.
